# ARD-005-Temperature-Alert-with-Arduino-UNO-Ek-R4-WiFi
Stay safe from extreme temperatures! This project uses a DHT11 sensor with Arduino UNO R4 WiFi to monitor temperature and humidity in real time. The readings are shown on an LCD, and the system displays a happy face ðŸ˜Š if the temperature is normal, or a blinking sad face ðŸ˜¢ if it gets too hot.
